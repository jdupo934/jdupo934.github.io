<h1> Joel Dupont</h1>
<h3>Senior in Greenville, South Carolina</h3>
<p>I am a Senior at Bob Jones University currently studying vocal perfomance.After graduation next semester I plan on returning to Bob Jones and pursuing a master's degree in Vocal Perforamance. I work on the 3rd floor of Fine Arts as a host</p>
<p>I enjoy pretty much anything.I especially enjoy helping with the music ministry at my churches at home, or here at school. I would say the most exciting thing right now is that I will be getting married on May 9th.</p>
